# Basics
Create a new console app:
```
dotnet new console -lang "F#" -name "ExploringConsole"
```
## Variables

#### nameof()

```
int height;
nameof(height)
```

### Numbers

```
int decimalNotation = 2_000_000;
int binaryNotation = 0b_0001_1110_0100_1000_0000;
int hexadecimalNotation = 0x_001E_8480;
decimalNotation == binaryNotation;			 	# true
decimalNotation == hexadecimalNotation;  		# true
```

```
sizeof(int) == 4
sizeof(double) == 8    // store wider range of number than decimal
sizeof(decimal) == 16  // more accurate. 12.75 is storeed as 1275 and
					   // a note to shift the decimal point two places left

double a = 0.1, b = 0.2;
decimal c = 0.1M, d = 0.2M;
a + b == 0.3  		   // false
c + d == 0.3M		   // true

// `double` type has useful special values
double.NaN
double.Epsilon
double.Infinity
```

**Tips:**

- Use `int` for whole numbers and `double` for real numbers that will not be compared to other values
- Use `decimal` for money, CAD drawings, general engineering and wherever accuracy is important

### String

#### Literal strings

```
// Escape characters like \t converted as a tab
string filePath = "C:\televisions\sony\bravia.txt";
```

#### Verbatim strings

```
string filePath = @"C:\televisions\sony\bravia.txt";
```

#### Interpolated strings

Prefixed with `$` to enable embedded formatted variables.

### Object

A special type can store any type of data. (Its flexibility brings messier code and possibly poor performance. Avoid it whenever possible.)

```
object height = 1.88;
object name = "Amir";

int length1 = name.Length; // gives compile error!
int lenght2 = ((string)name).Length;
```

### Dynamic types

Can also store any type of data, but even more than `object`, its flexibility comes at the cost of performance.

Compiler cannot check what the type is during build time. Instead, CLR checks for the member at runtime.

### Local variables

Defined inside methods.

`var` keyword can be used to declare local variables. The compiler will infer the type from the value. Inferred as `int` and `double` by default unless suffix`L` and `M' or 'F' is specified.

Use it only when the data type is obvious for code readability. If in doubt, spell it out!

### Getting default values for types

Most primitive types except `string` are **value types**, which means that they must have a value.

The `string` type is a `reference type`. This means that `string` variables contain the memory address of a value, not the value itself. A reference type can have a `null` value. `null` is a literal that indicates the variable doesn't reference anything yet and is the default for all reference types.

You can determine the default value of a type using the `default()` operator.

```
default(int)			// 0
default(bool)			// False
default(DateTime) // 01/01/0001 00:00:00
default(string)   // ""
```

### Working with null types

#### nullable value type

```
int thisCannotBeNull = null; // compile error!
int? thisCouldBenull = null;
Console.WriteLine(thisCouldBeNull.GetValueOrDefault());   // 0
```

#### Enabling nullable and non-nullable reference types

To enable the features at the project level:

```
<PropertyGroup>
	<Nullable>enable</Nullable>
</PropertyGroup>
```

To disable the feature at the file level:

```
#nullable disable
```

To enable the feature at the file level:

```
#nullable enable
```

#### Checking for null

Use the null-conditional operator `?.` when you are trying to use a member of a variable that might be `null`.

```
string authorName = null;
int x = authorName.Length;   // cause 'NullReferenceException'
int? y = authorName?.Length; // y == null
```

Use the null-coalescing operator `??` when you want to assign a variable to a result or an alternative value when the variable is null.

```
var result = authorname?.Length ?? 3;		// result == 3
```

## Exploring console applications further

### Displaying output

Using `Write` and `WriteLine`.

#### Formatting using numbered positional arguments

```
int nApples = 12;
decimal perApplePrice = 0.35M;

Console.WriteLine(
	format: "{0} apples costs {1:C}",
	arg0: nApples,
	arg1: perApplePrice * nApples);

string formatted = string.Format(
	format: "{0} apples costs {1:C}",
	arg0: nApples,
	arg1: perApplePrice * nApples);
```

#### Formatting using interpolated strings

A `string` prefixed with `$`:

```
Console.WriteLine($"{nApples} apples costs {perApplePrice * nApples:C}");
// 12 apples costs ï¿¡4.20
```

#### Understanding format strings

The full syntax of a format item is:

```
{ index [, alignment ] [: formatString]}
```

Positive integers are right-aligned and negative integers are left-aligned with the number width of characters.

- `N0`: thousand separators and no decimal places
- `C`: currency which is determined by the current thread.
  - e.g. If code is ran on a PC in UK you'll get pounds sterling with commas as the thousand separators
  - if on a PC in Germany, get Euros with dots as the thousand separators

### Get text input from the user

The `ReadLine` method waits for user to type some text, then as soon as the user presses _Enter_, whatever the user has typed is returned as a `string ` value.

### Importing a namespace

```
using System;
Console.WriteLine("");
```

### Getting key input from the user

```
Write("Press any key combination: ");
ConsoleKeyInfo key = ReadKey();
WriteLine();
WriteLine($"Key: {key.Key}", Char: {key.KeyChar}, Modifiers: {key.Modifiers});
// k => Key: K, Char: k, Modifiers: 0
// K => Key: K, Char: K, Modifiers: Shift
// k => Key: F12, Char: , Modifiers: 0
```

### Getting arguments

```
dotnet run firstarg second-arg third:arg "fourth arg"
```

## Controlling Flow and Converting Types

### Operating on variables

#### Unary Operators

- `++`/` --`
- typeof()
- sizeof()

#### Logical Operators

`&`, `|`,`^` 

#### Conditional Logical Operators

`&&`, `||` - Short-circuiting

#### Bitwise and bianry shift operators

`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`

### Selection statements

#### Pattern matching

The `if` statement can use the `is` keyword in combination with declaring a local variable to make your code safer.

```
object o = "3"; // add and remove the "" to change the behavior
if (o is int i)
{
	WriteLine($"{i} x 4 = {i * 4}");
}
else
{
	WriteLine("o is not an int so it cannot multiply!");
}
```

#### Switch statement

Compares a single expression against a list of multiple possible `case` statements.

Every `case` section must end with:

- The `break` keyword
- Or the `goto` keyword - goto a `case` or a Label
- Or they should have no statements

```
A_label:
  var number = (new Random()).Next(1, 7);
  WriteLine($"My random number is {number}");
  switch (number)
  {
    case 1:
      WriteLine("One");
      break;
    case 2:
      WriteLine("Two");
      goto case 1;
    case 3:
    case 4:
      WriteLine("Three or four");
      goto case 1;
    case 5:
      System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500);
      goto A_label;
    default:
    	WriteLine("Default");
    	break;
  }
```

#### Pattern matching with the switch statement

With pattern matching, the `case` can be patterns besides literal values.

```
using System.IO;

string path = "/Users/Workspace/Code/Chapter03";
Stream s = File.Open(
	Path.Combine(path, "file.txt"), FileMode.OpenOrCreate)
string msg = string.Empty;

switch (s)
{
  // `s` will only be a match if the stream is a `FileStream`
  // and its `CanWrite` property is `true`
	case FileStream writeableFile when s.CanWrite:
		msg = "The stream is a file that I can write to.";
		break;
	case FileStream readOnlyFile:
		msg = "The stream is a read-only file.";
		break;
	case MemoryStream ms:
		msg = "The stream is a memory address";
		break;
	default: // always evaluated last despite its current position
		msg = "The stream is some other type."
		break;
	case null:
		msg = "The stream is null.";
		break;
}
WriteLine(msg);
```

#### Simplifying switch statements with switch expressions

Separated by "," and "_" is used to represent the default return value.

```
msg = s switch
{
	FileStream writeableFile when s.CanWrite
		=> "The stream is a file that I can write to.",
	FileStream readOnlyFile
	  => "The stream is a read-only file.",
	MemoryStream ms
		=> "The stream is a memory address",
	null
		=> "The stream is null.",
	_
		=> "The stream is some other type."
}
```

### Iteration Statements

#### Looping with the `foreach` statement

Each item is usually read-only, if the sequence structure is modified during iteration, then an exception will be thrown.

Technically, the `foreach` statement will work on any type that follows these rules:

- The type must have a method named `GetEnumerator` that returns an object
- The returned object must have a property named `Current` and a method named `MoveNext`
- The `MoveNext` method must return `true` if there are more items to enumerate through or `false` if there are no more items.

The compiler turns the `foreach` statement in the preceding example into something similar to the following pseudocode:

```
IEnumerator e = names.GetEnumerator();
while (e.MoveNext)
{
	string name = (string)e.Current; // Current is read-only;
	WriteLine($"{name} has {name.Length} characters");
}
```

### Casting and converting between types

Two varieties: implicit (automatically and safe) and explicit (manually and may lose info).

```
int d = (int)9.8; // 9
```

#### Converting with the `System.Convert` type

```
using static System.Convert;
double g = 9.8;
int h = ToInt32(g);
WriteLine($"g is {g} and h is {h}");  // g is 9.8 and h is 10
```

### Rounding numbers

Using `ToInt()` - Banker's Rounding:

- It will round *up* if the decimal part is the midpoint .5 and the non-decimal part is odd, but it will round *down* if the non-decimal part is even.

```
ToInt(9.5) is 10
ToInt(10.5) is 10
```

#### Taking control of rounding rules

By using the `Round` method of the `Math` class enable the "away from zero" rounding rule (also known as rounding "up" or primary school rule).

```
double[] doubles = new[]{ 9.49, 9.5, 9.51, 10.49, 10.5, 10.51 };
foreach (double n in doubles)
{
	WriteLine(format:
		"Math.Round({0}, 0, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) is {1}",
		arg0: n,
		arg1: Math.Round(value: n,
			digits: 0,
			mode: MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero));
}
// Math.Round(9.49, 0, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) is 9
// Math.Round(9.5, 0, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) is 10
// Math.Round(9.51, 0, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) is 10
// Math.Round(10.49, 0, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) is 10
// Math.Round(10.5, 0, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) is 11
// Math.Round(10.51, 0, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero) is 11
```

### Converting from any type to a string

All types have a method named `ToString` that inherit from the `System.Object` class.

#### Converting from a binary object to a string

Sometimes you don't want to send the raw bits, because you don't know how those bits could be misinterpreted.

The safest way to do is to convert the binary object (e.g. image or video) into a `string` of safe characters. This is called **Base64** encoding.

```
byte[] binaryObject = new byte[128];

// populate array with random bytes
(new Random()).NextBytes(bianryObject);

WriteLine("Binary Object as bytes:");
for (int idx = 0; idx < binaryObject.Length; idx++)
{
	Write($"{binaryObject[idx]:X} ");  // to format the value using hexadecimal notation
}
WriteLine();

// convert to Base64 string and output as text
string encoded = Convert.ToBase64String(binaryObject);
WriteLine($"Bianry Object as Base64: {encoded}");
```

### Parsing from strings to numbers or dates and times

`Parse` is opposite to `ToString`. Only a few types have a `Parse` method, including all the number types and the `DateTime`.

```
int age = int.Parse("27");
DateTime birthday = DateTime.Parse("4 July 1980");
WriteLine($"My birthday is {birthday}.");   // 04/07/1980 00:00:00
WriteLine($"My birthday is {birthday:D}."); // 04 July 1980

int count = int.Parse("abc");  // => Unhandled Exception
```

#### Avoiding exceptions using the `TryParse` method

It returns `true` or `false`.

```
Write("How many eggs are there? ");
int count;
string input = Console.ReadLine();
if (int.TryParse(intput, out count))
{
	WriteLine($"There are {count} eggs.");
}
else
{
	WriteLine($"I could not parse the input.");
}
```

**Good practice:** Avoid writing code might throw an exception whenever possible, e.g. do `if` checks. But sometimes you can't, you could catch it.

#### Handling exceptions when converting types

##### Catching all exceptions

```
catch (Exception ex)
{
	WriteLine($"{ex.GetType()} says {ex.Message}");
}
```

##### Catching specific exceptions

The order in which you catch exceptions is important.

```
catch (FormationException)
{
	...
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
	...
}
```

### Checking for overflow

#### Throwing overflow exceptions with the checked statement

The `checked` statement tells .NET to throw an exception when an overflow happens.

```
try
{
	checked
  {
    int x = int.MaxValue - 1;
    WriteLine($"Initial value: {x++}");
    WriteLine($"After incrementing: {x++}");
    WriteLine($"After incrementing: {x++}");
    WriteLine($"After incrementing: {x++}");
  }
}
catch (OverflowException)
{
	WriteLine("...")
}

```

#### Disabling compiler overflow checks with the unchecked statement

A related keyword is `unchecked`. This keyword switches off overflow checks performed by compiler within a block of code.


## Function

### Documenting functions with XML comments

Improve the tooltip in VS Code by adding extra information with three '/'(C# XML Documentation Comments extension required).

```
/// <summary>
/// Pass a 32-bit integer and it will be converted into its ordinal equivalent.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="number">Number is a cardinal value e.g. 1, 2, 3, and so on.</param>
/// <returns>Number as on ordinal value e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on.</return>
static string CardinalToOrdinal(int number)
{ ... }
```

### Debugging Functions

#### Customising breakpoints

##### **Edit Breakpoint**:

- Expression - like the `var > 9`. The breakpoint is activated when the expression is `true`.
- Hit Count - You'd have to hit the breakpoint `number` times before it activates
- Log Msg

#### SharpPad extension for VS code

```
$ dotnet add package SharpPad
```
Modify Program.cs to import the `SharpPad` and `System.Threading.Tasks` namespaces, change the return type of the Main method to async Task, define a complex object variable, and then `dump` it to the SharpPad window, as shown in the following code:
```
using System;
using SharpPad;
using System.Threading.Tasks; using static System.Console;
namespace Dumping
{
  class Program
  {
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
      var complexObject = new {
        FirstName = "Petr", BirthDate = new DateTime(
        year: 1972, month: 12, day: 25),
        Friends = new[] { "Amir", "Geoff", "Sal" }
      };
      WriteLine($"Dumping {nameof(complexObject)} to SharpPad.");
      await complexObject.Dump();
    }
	}
}

```

### Logging

**Good Practice:** Add code throughout your application to log what is happening, and especially when exceptions occur, so that you can review the logs and use them to trace the issue and fix the problem.

There are two types that can be used to add simple logging to your code:

- `Debug`: used to add logging that gets written during development
- `Trace`: used to add logging that gets written during both development and runtime

#### Instrumenting with Debug and Trace

The `Debug` and `Trace` classes can write to any **[trace listener](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracelistener?view=netcore-3.0)**. A trace listener is a type that can be configured to write output anywhere you like when the `Trace.WriteLine` method is called.

You can write your own by inheriting from `TraceListener` type.

##### Writing to the default trace listener

The `DefaultTraceListener` class is configured automatically and writes to VS Code's DEBUG CONSOLE window.

```
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Instrumenting
{
	class Program
	{
		static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			Debug.WriteLine("Debug says, I am watching!");  // automatically stripped out when you build the release version of App
			Trace.WriteLine("Trace says, I am watching!");  // always there even after release
		}
	}
}
```

##### Configuring trace listeners

We can configure another trace listener that will write to a text file.

```
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.IO;

namespace Instrumenting
{
	class Program
	{
		static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			Trace.Listeners.Add(new TextWriterTraceListener(File.CreateText("log.txt")));
			Trace.AutoFlush = true;  // the default in-memory buffer could be confusing when debugging.
			Debug.WriteLine("Debug syas, I am watching!");
			Trace.WriteLine("Trace syas, I am watching!");
		}
	}
}
```

```
$ dotnet run --configuration Release		// avoid logging to console and only the "trace" line will show in file
$ dotnet run --configuration Debug      // both msgs
```

##### Switching trace levels

| Number | Word    | Description                             |
| ------ | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0      | Off     | This will output nothing                |
| 1      | Error   | Output only errors                      |
| 2      | Warning | Output errors and warnings              |
| 3      | Info    | Output errors, warnings and information |
| 4      | Verbose | Output all levels                       |

Some packages needed to enable loading configuration settings from a JSON `appsettings.json` file.

```
$ dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
$ dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder
$ dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json
$ dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.FileExtensions
```

Modify `appsettings.json` as:

```
{
	"PacktSwitch": {
		"Level": "Info"   // or "Level": "2"
	}
}
```

```
var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
	.SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
	.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);

IConfigurationRoot configuration = builder.Build();

var ts = new TraceSwitch(
	displayName: "PacktSwitch",
	description: "This switch is set via a JSON config.");

configuration.GetSection("PacktSwitch").Bind(ts);

Trace.WriteLineIf(ts.TraceError, "Trace error");
Trace.WriteLineIf(ts.TraceWarning, "Trace warning");
Trace.WriteLineIf(ts.TraceInfo, "Trace information");
Trace.WriteLineIf(ts.TraceVerbose, "Trace verbose");
```

### Unit Testing

- Arrange
- Act
- Assert

## Object-Oriented Programming

Concepts:

- Encapsulation - the combination of the data and actions that are related to an object.
  - Control what and how the internal state of an object can be accessed or modified from the outside
- Composition - about what an object is made of.
- Aggregation - about what can be combined with an object.
  - Two separate objects that are aggregated together to form a new component
  - e.g. A person is not part of a car object, but they could sit in the driver's seat
- Inheritance - about reusing code by having a subclass derive from a base or super class.
- Abstraction - about capturing the core idea of an object and ignore the details of specifics.
  - Base or super classes are often `abstract`
  - Abstraction is a tricky balance. More abstract, more classes would be able to inherit from it, but less functionality to share.
- Polymorphism - about allowing a derived class to override an inherited action to provide custom behaviour.

### Referencing an assembly

```
<ItemGroup>
	<ProjectReference Include="../PacktLibrary/PacktLibrary.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### Understanding objects

All types ultimately inherit directly or indirectly from a special type named `System.Object`.

### Class

#### Members

##### Fields

Used to store data. There are three specialised categories of field:

- Constant: The data never changes. The compiler copies the data into any code that reads it.
- Read-only: The data cannot change after the class is instantiated, but the data can be calculated or loaded from an external source at the time of instantiation.
- Event: The data references one or more methods that want to execute when something happens, such as clicking on a button, or responding to a request from other code.

###### Defining fields

```
public class Person : object
{
	// fields
	public string Name;
	public DataTime DateOfBirth;
}
```

###### Storing a value using an enum type



##### Methods

Used to execute statements. There are 4 categories of method:

- Constructor: The statements execute when you use the `new` keyword to allocate memory and instantiate a class.
- Property: The statements execute when you get or set data. Properties are the preferred way to encapsulate fields unless the memory address of the field needs to be exposed.
- Indexer: The statement execute when you get or set data using array syntax `[]`
- Operator: The statements execute when you use an operator like `+` or `/` on operands of your type.

##### Understanding access modifiers

By default it is `internal` for class and `private` for field.

| Access Modifier      | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `private`            | Member is accessible inside the type only. (Default)         |
| `internal`           | Member is accessible inside the type and any type in the same assembly. |
| `protected`          | Member is accessible inside the type and any type  that inherits from the type |
| `public`             | Member is accessible everywhere.                             |
| `internal protected` | Member is accessible inside the type, any type in the same assembly, and any type that inherits from the type. Equivalent to a fictional access modifier named `internal_or_protected`. |
| `private protected`  | Member is accessible inside the type, or any type that inherits from the type and is in the same assembly. (Equal to `internal_and_protected`) |

#### Class constructor

```csharp
static ClassName()  // only executed once when the class is loaded
{
	...
}
```

#### Instance constructor

```csharp
public ClassName()  // executed every time a new instance is created
{
    ...
}
```

#### Field and Property

``` csharp
class Student
{
    public int StuId;      // field
    
    private int name;
    private int age;
    private bool canWork;  // property that's dynamically calculated
    
    public int Name{ get; set; }
    public int Age         // property
    {
        get { return age; }
        set
        {
            age = value;
            this.CalculateCanWork();  // suitable for get_canWork() is called more frequent than set_age(); otherwise calculate when get_canWork is called.
        }
    }
    pulic bool CanWork
    {
        get { return canWork; }
    }
    
    private void CalculateCanWork()
    {
        if (this.age >= 16)
        {
            this.canWork = true;
        }
        else
        {
            this.canWork = false;
        }
    }
}
```

### Indexer





## Delegate

`Func` is a delegate that points to a method that accepts one or more arguments and returns a value. `Action` is a delegate that points to a method which in turn accepts one or more arguments but returns no value.

### Action
```
	Action action = new Action(obj.method_no_return);
	action.invoke();    // for short: action();
```

### Func

```
	Func<int, int, int> func = new Func<int, int, int>(obj.method_return); // return, arg1, arg2
	func.invoke(x, y);
```

### Self defined delegate class

```
public delegate double Calc(double x, double y);
```

### Usage

Pass a method as a parameter

#### 

#### Callback

Callbacks are normally  at the end of the code and have no return.  

Decide either needed to call a function and which function to call.
