## AWS Monitoring and Audit

### Why Monitoring is important

Users only care that the application is working:

- Application latency: will it increase over time?
- Application outages: customer experience should not be degraded
- Uses contacting the IT department or complaining is not a good outcome
- Troubleshooting and remediation

Internal monitoring:

- Can we prevent issues before they happen?
- Performance and cost
- Trends (scaling patterns)
- Learning and improvement

### Monitoring in AWS

- AWS CloudWatch
  - Metrics: Collect and track key metrics
  - Logs: collect, monitor, analyse and store log files
  - Events: Send notifications when certain events happen in your AWS
  - Alarms: React in real-time to metrics/ events
- AWS X-Ray
  - Troubleshooting application performance and errors
  - Distributed tracing of microservices
- AWS CloudTrail
  - Internal monitoring of API calls being made
  - Audit changes to AWS Resources by your users

### AWS CloudWatch

#### Metrics

CloudWatch provides metrics for every services in AWS. **Metric** is a variable to monitor (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn...).

- Metrics belong to **namespaces**.

- **Dimension** is an attribute of a metric (instance id, environment, etc...).
  - Up to 10 dimensions per metric.

- Metrics have timestamps.
- Can create CloudWatch dashboards of metrics

##### EC2 Detailed monitoring

EC2 instance metrics have metrics "every 5 minutes". With detailed monitoring (for a cost), you get data "every 1 minute". Use detailed monitoring if you want to more prompt scale your ASG.

The AWS Free Tier allows us to have 10 detailed monitoring metrics.

Note: EC2 Memory usage is by default not pushed (must be pushed from inside the instance as a custom metric).

##### AWS CloudWatch Custom Metrics

- Ability to use dimensions (attributes) to segment metrics:
  - Instance.id
  - Environment.name
- Metric resolution:
  - Standard: 1 minute
  - High Resolution: up to 1 second (*StorageResolution* API parameter) - Higher cost
- Use API call `PutMetricData`
- Use exponential back off in case of throttle errors

#### Alarms

Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric. Alarms can go to Auto Scaling, EC2 Actions, SNS notifications.

**Various options:** sampling, %, max, min, etc...

**Alarm States:**

- OK
- INSUFFICIENT_DATA
- ALARM

**Period:**

- Length of time in seconds to evaluate the metric
- High resolution custom metrics: can only choose 10 sec or 30 sec

#### Logs

Applications can send logs to CloudWatch using SDK.

- CloudWatch can collect log from:
  - Elastic Beanstalk: collection of logs from application
  - ECS: collection from containers
  - AWS Lambda: collection from function logs
  - VPC Flow Logs: VPC specific logs
  - API Gateway
  - CloudTrail based on filter
  - CloudWatch log agents: for example on EC2 machines
  - Route53: Log DNS queries

- CloudWatch Logs can go to:
  - Batch exporter to S3 for archival
  - Stream to ElasticSearch cluster for further analytics
- CloudWatch Logs can use filter expressions
- Logs storage architecture:
  - Log groups: arbitrary name, usually representing an application
  - Log stream: instances within application/ log files/ containers
- Can define log expiration policies at Log Groups level (never expire by default)
- Using the AWS CLI we can tail CloudWatch logs
- To send logs to CloudWatch, make sure IAM permissions are correct
- Security: encryption of logs using KMS at the Group Level

##### CloudWatch Logs for EC2

By default, no logs from your EC2 machine will go to CloudWatch. You need to run a **CloudWatch agent** on EC2 to push the log files you want. (Make sure IAM permissions are correct)

##### CloudWatch Logs Agent & Unified Agent

They are both for virtual servers (EC2 instances, on-premise servers...).

###### CloudWatch Logs Agent

- Old version of the agent
- Can only send to CloudWatch Logs

###### CloudWatch Unified Agent

- Collect additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes, etc...
- Collect logs to send to CloudWatch Logs
- Centralised configuration using SSM Parameter Store

##### CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter

CloudWatch Logs can use filter expressions:

- e.g.
  - find a specific IP inside of a log
  - count occurrences of "ERROR" in your logs
- Metric filters can be used to trigger alarms

Filters do not retroactively filter data. Filters only publish the metric data points for events that happen after the filter was created. 

#### Events

Types:

- **Schedule:** Cron jobs
  - Fixed rate
  - Cron expression
- **Event Pattern:** Event rules to react to a service doing something.

Trigger to Lambda functions, SQS/ SNS/ Kinesis Messages

CloudWatch Event creates a small JSON document to give information about the change.

##### EventBridge

EventBridge is the next evolution of CloudWatch Events.

**Default event bus:** generated by AWS services (CloudWatch Events).

**Partner event bus:** receive events from SaaS service or applications (Zendesk, DataDog, Segment, Auth0...)

**custom Event buses:** for your own applications

Event buses can be accessed by other AWS accounts.

**Rules:** how to process the events (similar to CloudWatch Events)

###### Amazon EventBridge Schema Registry

EventBridge can analyse the events in your bus and infer the schema. Schema means how the data is structured.

The **Schema Registry** allows you to generate code for your application, that will know in advance how data is structured in the event bus. Schema can be versioned.

##### Amazon EventBridge vs CloudWatch Events

Amazon EventBridge builds upon and extends CloudWatch Events. It uses the same service API and endpoint, and the same underlying service infrastructure.

EventBridge allows extension to add event buses for your custom applications and your third-party SaaS apps. EventBridge has the Schema Registry capability. EventBridge has a different name to mark the new capabilities.

Over time, the CloudWatch Events name will be replaced with EventBridge.

### X-Ray

- Debugging in Production, the good old way:
  - Test locally
  - Add log statements everywhere
  - Re-deploy in production

Debugging a monolith is "easy" but distributed services are "hard". Not to say log formats differ across applications using CloudWatch and analytics. And there is no common views of your entire architecture.

AWS X-Ray supports visual analysis of our applications.

#### AWS X-Ray advantages

- Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks)
- Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture
- Pinpoint service issues
- Review request behaviour
- Find errors and exceptions
- Are we meeting time SLA?
- Where I am throttled?
- Identify users that are impacted

#### X-Ray compatibility

AWS Lambda/ Elastic Beanstalk/ ECS/ ELB/ API Gateway/ EC2 Instances or any application server (even on premise)

#### AWS X-Ray Leverages Tracing

Tracing is an end to end way to following a "request". Each component dealing with the request adds its own "trace". Tracing is made of segments (+ sub segments).

Annotations can be added to traces to provide extra-information. Ability to trace:

- Every request
- Sample request (as a % or a rate per minute)

X-Ray Security:

- IAM for authorisation
- KMS for encryption at rest

#### How to enable X-Ray

1. Your code must import the AWS X-Ray SDK
   - Very little code modification needed
   - The application SDK will then capture
     - Calls to AWS services
     - HTTP/ HTTPS requests
     - Database Calls (MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB)
     - Queue calls (SQS)
2. Install the X-Ray daemon or enable X-Ray AWS Integration
   - X-Ray daemon works as a low level UDP packet interceptor
   - AWS Lambda/ other AWS services already run the X-Ray daemon for you
   - Each application must have the IAM rights to write data to X-Ray

So the application with AWS X-Ray SDK will send traces to the X-Ray Daemon that's running on machine and Daemon will send batch every 1 second to AWS X-Ray.

#### The X-Ray magic

X-Ray service collects data from all the different services. Service map is computed from all the segments and traces. X-Ray is graphical, so even non technical people can help troubleshooting.

#### AWS X-Ray Troubleshooting

If X-Ray is not working on EC2:

- Ensure the EC2 IAM Role has the proper permissions
- Ensure the EC2 instance is running the X-Ray Daemon

To enable on AWS Lambda:

- Ensure it has an IAM execution role with proper policy (AWSX-RayWriteOnlyAccess)
- Ensure that X-Ray is imported in the code

#### X-Ray Instrumentation in your code

Instrumentation means the measure of product's performance, diagnose, errors, and to write trace information.

To instrument your application code, you use the X-Ray SDK. Many SDK require only configuration changes. You can modify your application code to customise and annotation the data that the SDK sends to X-Ray, using interceptors, filters, handlers, middleware.

#### X-Ray Concepts

**Segments:** each application/ service will send them

**Subsegments:** if you need more details in your segment

**Trace:** segments collected together to form an end-to-end trace

**Sampling:** decrease the amount of requests send to X-Ray, reduce cost

**Annotations:** Key Value pairs used to index traces and use with filters

**Metadata:** Key Value pairs, not indexed, not used for searching

Th e X-Ray daemon/ agent has a config to send traces cross account:

- make sure the IAM permissions are correct - the agent will assume the role
- This allows to have a central accounts for all your application tracing

#### X-Ray Sampling Rules

With sampling rules, you control the amount of data that you record. You can modify sampling rules without changing your code. By default, the X-Ray SDK records the first request each second, and five percent of any additional requests.

**One request per second** is the **reservoir**, which ensures that at least one trace is recorded each second as long the services is serving requests.

**Five percent** is the rate at which additional requests beyond the reservoir size are sampled.

#####  X-Ray Custom Sampling Rules

You can create your own rules with the reservoir and rate.

#### X-Ray Write APIs (used by the X-Ray daemon)

**PutTraceSegments:** Uploads segment documents to AWS X-Ray

**PutTelemetryRecords:** Used by the AWS X-Ray daemon to upload telemetry

- SegmentsReceivedCount
- SegmentsReceivedCounts
- BackendConnectionErrors...

**GetSamplingRules:** Retrieve all sampling rules (to know what/ when to send)

**GetSamplingTargets** & **GetSamplingStatisticsSummaries**: advanced

#### X-Ray Read APIs

**GetServiceGraph:** main graph

**BatchGetTraces:** Retrieves a list of traces specified by ID. Each trace is a collection of segment documents that originates from a single request

**GetTraceSummaries:** Retrieves IDs and annotations for traces available for a specified time frame using an optional filter. To get the full traces, pass the trace IDs to BatchGetTraces.

**GetTraceGraph:** Retrieves a service graph for one or more specific trace IDs.

#### X-Ray with Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk platforms include the X-Ray daemon. You can run the daemon by setting an option in the Elastic Beanstalk console or with a configuration file (in `.ebextensions/xray-daemon.config`)

```
option_settings:
	aws:elasticbeanstalk:xray:
		XRayEnabled: true
```

Make sure to give your instance profile the correct IAM permissions so that the X-Ray daemon can function correctly.

Then make sure your application code is instrumented with the X-Ray SDK.

Note: The X-Ray daemon is not provided for Multicontainer Docker.

#### [X-Ray & ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon-ecs.html#xray-daemon-ecs-build)

3 options:

1. X-Ray Container as a Daemon running on every EC2 instances of ECS Cluster.

2. "Side car" pattern
   - One X-Ray Sidecar along side each App container.
3. Fargate Cluster
   - X-Ray Container as a "Side Car"

### AWS CloudTrail

Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account. CloudTrail is enabled by default. Get an history of events/ API calls made within your AWS Account by: Console/ SDK/ CLI/ AWS Services.

Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs. If a resource is deleted in AWS, look into CloudTrail first.

### CloudTrail vs CloudWatch vs X-Ray

CloudTrail:

- Audit API calls made by users/ services/ AWS Console
- Useful to detect unauthorised calls or root cause of changes

CloudWatch:

- CloudWatch Metrics over time for monitoring
- CloudWatch Logs for storing application log
- CloudWatch Alarms to send notifications in case of unexpected metrics

X-Ray

- Automated Trace Analysis & Central Service Map Visualisation
- Latency, Errors and Fault analysis
- Request tracking across distributed systems
